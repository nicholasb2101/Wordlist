#### Information:
This is a compilation of wordlists that I have found to be most useful for 'projects' requiring wordlists and I will continue adding as I find and use more. It contains approximately 1.4 million different words/text, numbers and symbols. They are ordered symbollically, numerically and finally alphabetically and are American English in spelling. they contain phrases relevant to company names, common words, common passwords, IT related topics, ect. As previously mentioned this list will continue to be updated with relevant data.
